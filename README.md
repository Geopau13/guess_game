# guess_game
This is a basic game created with Pygame
In this game, a GuessingGame class is defined with an __init__ method to initialize the game state. The play method is responsible for the main game loop, where the user is prompted to make guesses. The check_guess method compares the user's guess to the randomly generated number and provides feedback. The game continues until the user correctly guesses the number.
